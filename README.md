Algorithms
----------

Algorithms is a C# project containing implementations of some interesting and/or complex algorithms.

### Contents
**A\* Experiment** - [A\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) is a popular traversal algorithm used for finding paths between vertices (nodes) in a graph.  It's also a topic which is often asked about in more advanced coding interviews, and in interviews for certain relevant areas of software engineering (gaming, social networks, search, etc...).  This project gives a sample implementation of A*, and looks at how different heuristic functions can affect the speed of finding a path through the graph.

### Future Additions
- An optimized solution to the 'Cracking the Coding Interview' 'Max Black Square' problem.
- A solution to the 'Cracking the Coding Interview' 'Word Rectangle' problem.
